    This day turned out to be shit. It seemed to be part of a theme. The week was shit, the month was shit, the year, his life. It all seemed spiraling and dark and, well, shitty. The x files had been stagnating in recent months, every case ending up a dead end or a hoax or not worth their time and effort. Paperwork piled up around him and Scully to the point of suffocation, but all they could do was work through it in between the dead-end cases and hoaxes. It was just becoming pointless. Even his sketchy sources were dry, and the Gunmen hadn't given him anything new in ages. He had no motivation left in him.

    Mulder sighed. It was Friday night and he was at a bar. He couldn't stomach the thought of going home with nothing new to work on, nothing to obsess over besides the same loose threads he'd been investigating for decades. The bar was little more to him than a change in scenery. He'd nursed a few beers already, and this one was steadily getting warmer as he sat and stared at the wood of the bar. More and more people were coming in as the night got later, all laughing and with friends. Mulder absently wondered was Scully was up to this weekend, and realized that they had barely spoken in the last few days save meaningless details about case files and coffee refills.

    The bar was already too crowded for the mopey vibe he had going and the increased volume of happiness was grating on his nerves. Mulder nodded at the bartender, left a tip and got off his stool, giving up. He decided to walk home instead of driving, despite the distance, to waste a little more time. A light drizzle further set the scene of his mood, making him uncomfortably humid and chilled at the same time. Glum, thy name is Mulder.

    The further away from the bar he got the less people he passed until he was the only one on the block. Despite the beer, he knew he wouldn't be able to sleep easily tonight and contemplated on going on a run to wear himself out, then decided running alone, at night, in the rain was too depressing even for him and decided to watch late night infomercials instead. What an exciting life he led.

    A loud clang made him jump slightly and look at the alleyway where it originated. A dog started barking and snarling at something behind a dumpster. Mulder didn't hesitate to investigate. This was the most compelling thing to happen around him in weeks. It was a mystery! Anything could be down that alleyway! A dead body, a stack of stolen money, aliens!

    Okay, maybe the alcohol had a little effect on his sensibilities after all.

    The dog wasn't letting up, if anything it was getting louder as it had presumably cornered whatever caught its attention. Mulder had half a mind to grab it and see if it was lost or something, but as soon as it noticed Mulder it ran off and disappeared into the depths of the alley. It was darker back here than he realized and it took his eyes a moment to adjust and see more than shadows. Looking at the area where the dog had been, he didn't see the D.C. Devil, or a mothman victim in front of him. In fact, it seemed like there was nothing there at all. Ghosts? Nah, he should be so lucky. Fighting disappointment, Mulder almost left the alley as it started raining harder, but a sodden newspaper moved slightly just at the edge of the dumpster and caught his attention.

    He took a few steps closer and managed to get his shoe wet in a hidden puddle. He had to move a few larger pieces of trash before he could get to the paper, and when he moved it away he was further surprised by the sight in front of him.

    A tiny, dark-haired kitten, completely drenched and shaking, was staring back up at him in terror. Mulder froze. The first thought through his mind was inexplicably Sarah MacLauchlan's faint voice from an ASPCA commercial he must've seen a million times. He didn't know kittens could look this pathetic in real life! For god's sake, it looked so tiny and afraid, but it couldn't escape from the corner in was backed in to, likely when the little guy ran from the dog that was terrorizing it.

    Its body was sort of contorted away from him, like it was afraid it was about to be attacked again, and part of Mulder's soul shattered at the sight. He oved a little closer and it gave a silent hiss at him that almost knocked him over in its adorable sadness. Okay, maybe the beers he had made him a little emotional, too. Yeah. We'll blame it on that.

    "Hey little guy," said Mulder in what he hoped was a soothing voice to a scared cat. "Hey, it's okay, I got ya. No more big dog barking at you, yeah?"

    He stooped a little lower, bracing one arm on the rough brick wall and scooped up the little animal with his free hand before it could try to make an escape. Instinctively he brought the kitten close to his chest and through the gap in his jacket to give it a little protection from the rain. He could feel it sink its tiny, needle like claws into his hand as it shivered, not knowing still if Mulder was friend or foe.

    "Shhh, it's okay. I think. We'll see, little guy. Do you have a home someplace?"

    Helplessly, Mulder squinted around the alley in the darkness, walking a little further in to see if the animal had just been separated from his mother or a cat family or whatever form stray cats hung out in in the rain-quickly he realized that it was a fruitless search.

    "Okay, yeah, stupid question. I wouldn't want to live here either."

    He stood still for a moment, the kitten still shivering in his arm, until a crack of thunder made him jump. He accidently squeezed the animal in his hand, causing it to squirm and squeak faintly until he let up the pressure. There was nothing to do except go home now that it was raining harder with the thunder and lightning overhead.

    "Aw, little guy. I guess I'll just take you with me, yeah?" He made his way back toward the street. "Ok, that's right. Just calm down, ow stop that, there we go."

    Miraculously, a cab appeared just in time for Mulder to flag it down. Did cabs take animals in them? Just to be safe he zipped up his jacket more with the kitten now attaching its claws to his shirt and braced his arm over the small bulge in his jacket as he got into the cab.

    Well, this certainly was a change in his Friday night situation. What the hell was he going to do now with a tiny, sodden mess of a cat that, yes, smelled like the dumpster he found it by? There was no chance in hell he'd just toss the poor creature aside in this weather, he wasn't a monster for god's sake. And who knows if there were other dogs or mean animals waiting to eat the helpless animal. He couldn't imagine going to an animal shelter either. It hardly looked old enough to take care of itself, especially in the middle of the city, and he wasn't sure where a shelter would even be, or if they would treat the kitten well.

    A few faint meows luckily escaped the notice of the driver as Mulder tried to shush the wet bundle in his jacket. He silently accepted his new role as a cat owner as he felt the little thing squirm inside his jacket.

    The cab pulled up to the curb just as the kitten nestled a little closer and started to purr against the heat of his chest. Mulder awkwardly paid the driver and stumbled out into the rain again, protectively supporting the kitten as he jogged up to his building and went inside. He rushed up and to his door, half excited to take a good look at his new little friend and half wondering what the hell he'd gotten himself into this time.
